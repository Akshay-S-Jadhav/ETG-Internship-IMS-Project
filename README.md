# ETG-Internship-IMS-Project
# Introduction
Hey, I am Akshay Jadhav and this project is regarding Inventory management System which was a 1st Assignment given by ETG during internship.
First of all I'd like to give a vote of thanks to ETG for providing me this opportunity to be a part of Internship, Thank you Elite Techno Group.

# Regarding Project

It is IMS of an electronic Shop, In which first I created a dictionary called Elec_device_record and then dump it into a json file. Then added some 
function to make it interactive. 

# Functions
Functions such as addrecord(), purchase(), update(), discount() and the main() function to start the program.

# More
I was facing some issue with json file so I could'nt make the sales file, but as time pass by I'll try to improve it.
Thank You !!!
